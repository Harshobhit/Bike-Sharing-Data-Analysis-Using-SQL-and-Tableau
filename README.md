<b><ins><h3>Aim of the Study</h3></strong></ins>
<ol>
  <h5>
    <li>
      As part of problem statement need to provide insights(backed from data) to steer major business decisions,   which would help in scaling up the existing user base and  
      optimize the internal operations of the company Zulip(hypothetical).
    </li>
    <li>
      Zulip provides bike-sharing service between different train stations.Customers can use the bikes available at the train station for commuting to/from the 
      train stations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Zulip is currently facing some losses and have decided to shutdown operations for 3 stations.As a data analyst need to decide which 3 stations to shut down 
      after getting the insights from the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Throughout the day, bikes keep moving around the city due to the trips. Zulip has to find out how to effectively move bikes around to ensure the demand is met 
      with adequate supply. This is to ensure that at any time, there are sufficient bikes available at a given station.So, as a data analyst need to come up with 
      some possible solutions to manage the demand and supply of bikes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Zulip is also planning to start a new line called Couple Bikes. This will enable two persons to travel from one station to another at the same time.Need to 
      think of factors that need to be considered while validating the idea of couple bikes.

<b><ins><h3>Process followed for Data Analysis</h3></strong></ins>
<ul><h5>
  <li>
    The data is provided in the data directory which was then imported in MySQL database using MySql workbench.
  </li>
  <li>
    For doing the exploratory data anlysis SQL was used to analyze the data and find patterns in data.
  </li>
  <li>
  While studying the data and looking at the problemen statement some questions were created in order which would help in getting more out of the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    For answering the data related questions, sql queries were created in order to gain insights from the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    The SQL queries and their corresponding output are documented inside a pdf file which is added to the repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    After carefully looking at the output of sql queries and the data visulizations multiple hypothesis were provided for solving problems related to:
    <ol>
      <li>Which 3 train stations to shut down?</li>
      <li>How to manage the supply-demand gap?</li>
   </ol>
  <li>
    The output from SQL queries was exported to excel and via Tableau desktop application data visualization was done.
  </li>
  <li>
    A presentation was created by carefully looking at the insights received from SQL queries and Tableau visualizations to answer the questions asked in problem 
    statement.
